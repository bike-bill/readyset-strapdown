### Overview

*TODO: Answer the questions below to help you design the user interface
features of your system. Some ecomponents.htmlxample text is provided. Add or delete
text as needed.*

#### What are the most important facts that a developer should know about the user interface of this system?

::PARAGRAPH OR BULLETS

#### What are the ranked goals for the user interface of this system?

1. ::[Understandability and learnability](glossary-std.html#understandability_and_learnability)
2. ::[Task support and efficiency](glossary-std.html#task_support_and_efficiency)
3. ::[Safety](glossary-std.html#safety)
4. ::[Consistency and familiarity](glossary-std.html#consistency_and_familiarity)

### Metaphors, Exemplars, and Standards
&nbsp;

#### What is the central metaphor of this UI design?

::PARAGRAPH

#### What existing systems have user interfaces similar to the UI you want to build? What specific aspects are similar?

- ::[amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com): Our e-commerce site will
  have stores and departments, and search like this site.
- ::[Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/using/default.asp): We
  will use configurable toolbars the same way Office 2000 does.
- ::[EXISTING-UI](LINK-TO-SYSTEM): DESCRIPTION

#### What UI design standards, guidelines, and styles are you following?

- ::[Microsoft UI guidelines](hcomponents.htmlttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp)
- ::[Java UI guidelines](http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed1/guidelines.html)

### Task Models
&nbsp;

#### What types of users will use this system?

::See the [user needs document](user-needs).

#### What types of tasks will those users perform?

::See the [use case suite](use-case-suite).

### Content Model / Interaction Contexts

*TODO: List interaction contexts. Each interaction context is a "place"
where users see information and where they select commands or options.
In a graphical user interface, a interaction context will eventually be
implemented as a window or dialog box. In other applications, an
interaction context may be implemented as, e.g., a web page, a voice
menu prompt, or a physical control panel.*

*TIP: Each interaction context is an exclusive mode: the user can only
use one interaction context at a time. All the components within one
context are visible and usable at the same time. E.g., if a window has
three tabs, that is three interaction contexts because only one tab can
be used at a time.*

*TODO: For each interaction context, list the abstract components within
that context. Each component is a piece of information, or a user
interface affordance. In a GUI, each abstract component will eventually
become a widget, but the choice of specific widgets happens later.
Choice of abstract components corresponds to step 2 in the 
[HTML prototyping example](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jrobbins/htmlproto/index.html)
demonstrated in class.*

*TIP: Most high frequency use cases should be carried out in only one
interaction contexts. A use case that requires three interaction
contexts could be hard to use. However, interaction contexts with too
many components can also be hard to use.*

Interaction Context --Abstract UI Components	Purpose	Contents / Constraints / Behavior
::Login dialog	::Verify that the current user is actually the person that they claim to be.


### Technical Constraints / Operational Contextualization
&nbsp;

#### What are your assumptions about the output devices?

::  We assume that the user has a 17-inch or larger screen with 1024x768
    pixels that can display thousands of colors (16 bit or more). We
    assume basic audio that can play simple sound files.

::  We make very few assumptions about the user's screen or web browser,
    other than the assumption that they can view page somehow. We will
    not use any audio features.

::  This "pay-at-the-pump" system has a 320x200 16-color display and
    can beep.

#### What are your assumptions about the input devices that you will use?

::  We assume only that the user has a standard keyboard and mouse.

::  This "pay-at-the-pump" system has digits 0-9, "OK", "Cancel", and
    four menu buttons along the right-hand edge of the screen.

#### What are your assumptions about the amount of time users will spend on tasks?

::  Use cases UC-02 and UC-04 are expected to take a few minutes each.
    Use case UC-00 should take less than 5 seconds each. All other use
    cases should take less than 30 seconds each.

#### What windowing systems, UI libraries, or other UI technologies will you use?

::  Standard Java Swing with no extra libraries.

::  Simple HTML and CSS with simple GIF images.

### User Interface Checklist

*TODO: Answer the following questions to help evaluate the design. You
may add or remove questions to fit your project.*

#### Understandability and learnability
&nbsp;

##### Are there any labels of icons that are likely to be misunderstood?

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Is the user's current place and state clearly visible? E.g., wizard step 2 of 5, or edit-mode vs. play-mode.

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Are advanced options clearly separated from the most commonly used options?
::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Are there no invisible options or commands? E.g., hold down the control key when opening a dialog box to see advanced options.

::1-3 SENTENCES

#### Task Support and Efficiency
&nbsp;

##### Which use cases force the user to work through more than two interaction contexts?

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Which use cases force the user to perform slow or difficult UI steps? E.g., entering a long code number like an ISBN. E.g., long mouse-drag operations.

::1-3 SENTENCES

#### Safety
&nbsp;

##### Are there any dangerous or irreversible actions that are done with only one step?

::1-3 SENTENCES

#### Consistency and Familiarity
&nbsp;
##### Do UI elements in your system work the same as they do in the existing example systems you identified?

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Do all elements in your system that appear the same, actually function the same?

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Do all elements in your system that appear the same, actually function the same?

::1-3 SENTENCES

##### Are all elements share consistent visual characteristics such as font and color scheme, unless there is a reason for them to differ?

::1-3 SENTENCES

#####Are labels used consistently throughout the system? E.g., not "forward/back" in some contexts and "next/prev" in others.
