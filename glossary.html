## Glossary
--------

**Process impact:** This file as a dictionary of terms defined as they
are used during the project. Writing out the definitions of terms and
acronyms here helps keep other documents more concise and precise. A
shared glossary helps prevent misunderstandings and makes it easier for
new team members to be productive.

[Standard terms](glossary-std.html#standard_terms)

### Project-specific Terms

TIPs:

* Define HTML anchors on your terms with id="TERMNAME" so that other
  documents can link to the definition of specific terms.
* If there is any question about the meaning of a term, note it here.
  If someone (e.g., the customer) gave you a definition to use, note
  that here too. If something is best defined by using a hyperlink to
  another document or website, include a hyperlink in the definition.
* If a term was used in the past, but is no longer going to be used,
  you should keep it in the list, mark it as "deprecated", and link to
  the term or terms that replace it. E.g., deprecated standard term
  [bug](glossary-std.html#bug).
* Define only project-specific terms, or ones that a new team member
  would not know. Don't define standard textbook terms that can be
  easily found elsewhere.
* This glossary can serve as simple domain model or data dictionary.
  You can define important data objects by describing their meaning
  and key attributes. For example, see [student](#student) and
  [GPA](#gpa).
