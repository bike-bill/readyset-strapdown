*TODO: Note any aspects that are common to all use cases here. This helps
keep the use cases themselves short. If any use case is an exception,
note it's specific value to replace or add to the default.*

### Default Aspects of All Use Cases

**Direct Actors:**

-	::User: end-user in any role
-	::System: The system being built
-	::When actors are not listed, assume User is doing it.
-	::Items beginning with "see" indicate that System has presented a new screen.

**Stakeholders:**

::Project Owners and other members

**Prereq:**

::User is logged in

*TODO: For each use case listed in the [use case
suite](use-case-suite), create an HTML anchor and heading with it's
unique ID, then fill in the rows of the table to specify the use case in
detail.*

*TIP: It is OK to simply list the names of a lot of use cases without
actually writing the use case in detail. Document the most important use
cases first and come back to less important ones later.*

*TIP: See detailed tips in the [guidelines for writing usecases](use-case-format.html#guidelines).*
