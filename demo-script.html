### Demo Script

*TODO: Outline the steps of the demo. Plan out what you will do and say.
Practice three times to make sure that all system features actually work
as needed, and that there is enough time.*

*TIP: Imagine that you are in the audience. Do you understand what is
being shown at each step? Is the demo too fast? Too slow? Too long? Are
you interested? What are your questions or concerns? Do you strongly
disagree with any points?*
