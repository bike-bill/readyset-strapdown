Some ecomponents.htmlxample text is provided. Add or delete\ntext as needed.*\n\n#### What are the most important facts that a developer should know about the user interface of this system?\n\n::PARAGRAPH OR BULLETS\n\n#### What are the ranked goals for the user interface of this system?\n\n1. ::[Understandability and learnability](glossary-std.html#understandability_and_learnability)\n2. ::[Task support and efficiency](glossary-std.html#task_support_and_efficiency)\n3. ::[Safety](glossary-std.html#safety)\n4. ::[Consistency and familiarity](glossary-std.html#consistency_and_familiarity)\n\n### Metaphors, Exemplars, and Standards\n&nbsp;\n\n#### What is the central metaphor of this UI design?\n\n::PARAGRAPH\n\n#### What existing systems have user interfaces similar to the UI you want to build? What specific aspects are similar?\n\n- ::[amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com): Our e-commerce site will\n  have stores and departments, and search like this site.\n- ::[Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/using/default.asp): We\n  will use configurable toolbars the same way Office 2000 does.\n- ::[EXISTING-UI](LINK-TO-SYSTEM): DESCRIPTION\n\n#### What UI design standards, guidelines, and styles are you following?\n\n- ::[Microsoft UI guidelines](hcomponents.htmlttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp)\n- ::[Java UI guidelines](http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed1/guidelines.html)\n- ::[Mac UI guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Essentials/AquaHIGuidelines/AHIGHIGs/index.html)\n- ::[W3C Accessibility guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/)\n\n### Task Models\n&nbsp;\n\n#### What types of users will use this system?\n\n::See the [user needs document](user-needs).\n\n#### What types of tasks will those users perform?\n\n::See the [use case suite](use-case-suite).\n\n### Content Model / Interaction Contexts\n\n*TODO: List interaction contexts. Each interaction context is a \"place\"\nwhere users see information and where they select commands or options.\nIn a graphical user interface, a interaction context will eventually be\nimplemented as a window or dialog box. In other applications, an\ninteraction context may be implemented as, e.g., a web page, a voice\nmenu prompt, or a physical control panel.*\n\n*TIP: Each interaction context is an exclusive mode: the user can only\nuse one interaction context at a time. All the components within one\ncontext are visible and usable at the same time. E.g., if a window has\nthree tabs, that is three interaction contexts because only one tab can\nbe used at a time.*\n\n*TODO: For each interaction context, list the abstract components within\nthat context. Each component is a piece of information, or a user\ninterface affordance. In a GUI, each abstract component will eventually\nbecome a widget, but the choice of specific widgets happens later.\nChoice of abstract components corresponds to step 2 in the \n[HTML prototyping example](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jrobbins/htmlproto/index.html)\ndemonstrated in class.*\n\n*TIP: Most high frequency use cases should be carried out in only one\ninteraction contexts. A use case that requires three interaction\ncontexts could be hard to use. However, interaction contexts with too\nmany components can also be hard to use.*\n\n| Interaction Context --Abstract UI Components   | Purpose                                                                                                          | Contents / Constraints / Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                       \n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ::[Login dialog](LINK-TO-MOCKUP)               | ::Verify that the current user is actually the person that they claim to be.                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                     \n| ::--Prompt\t                                 | ::Tell the user that this dialog is to log in.\t                                                                | ::\"Please log in\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ::--Message area                               | ::Give the user some feedback about the login process.\t                                                        | ::Initially blank.

The database limits login by that user to only\nthe IP-address used by the application server.\n\n#### Is this application's central database accessible to other applications?\n\n::Yes. The database is an important point of interoperability for new\napplications to be added later. The database itself provides support\nfor access controls and checks validity constraints so that a\ndefective application cannot corrupt the database.\n\n::No. This database should always be accessed through\nthis application. All relevant pieces of information are available\nthrough the application interfaces. The database itself does not\nprotect against data corruption that could be caused by\nother applications.\n\n### File Storage\n&nbsp;\n#### What data needs to be stored in files?\n\n::Nothing is stored in files, everything is in the database.\n\n::The server stores most data in the database, but mailing list\nattachments are written to files on the server hard disk.\n\n::All user documents are stored in files on their computer hard disk.\n\n#### What are the conventions for directory structure and file naming?\n\n::N/A\n\n::Files are stored on the server as\n   \n```/var/data/attachments/msgNNNN-MMM.dat```\n\n::Users store files anywhere on their computer, with the filename\n  extension ```.TST```.\n\n#### What file system access controls will be used?\n\n::N/A\n\n::Files for message attachments are only readable and writable by the\n  mailing list archiving process that runs as operating system\n  user \"archdaemon\".\n\n::Users can use whatever file permissions they like.\n\n#### What file format will be used?\n\n::The [XYZ](LINK-TO-STANDARD) standard file format.\n\n::A java .properties file.\n\n::A window's .ini file.\n\n::An XML file using [this DTD file](LINK-TO-DTD).\n\n::A simple text file with the following format: ...\n\n::A custom binary file in the following format: ...\n\n### Distributed Storage\n&nbsp;\n#### What information (if any) will be stored on client machines? For how long?\n\n::A cookie will be stored on the user machine for the purpose of\nidentifying a user session. When the user logs out or closes their\nweb browser, the cookie is deleted. Most browsers will not even\nwrite this cookie to the disk.\n\n::The a cookie is stored on the user's computer that is equivalent to\ntheir password (but it is NOT actually their password). This cookie\nis needed for the auto-login feature. The cookie lasts a maximum of\n30 days, and it can only be used from the same IP address.\n\n::User preferences for color scheme are stored in cookies in\ntheir browser. This information is not at all sensitive, so it is\nkept indefinitely.\n\n::All the user data will be stored on files on their computers.\n\n### Persistence Mechanisms Checklist\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Expressiveness: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Ease of access: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Reliability: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Capacity: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Security: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Performance: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Interoperability: To what extent has this been achieved?\n\n::2-4 SENTENCES\n\n#### Has the persistence design been communicated to the development team and other stakeholders?\n\n::Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.\n\n::No, this is a risk that is noted in the [Risk Management](plan.html#risks)\nsection.\n\n<!-- End Markdown content -->\n</xmp>\n\n<div w3-include-html=\"_words-of-wisdom.html\"></div>\n<div w3-include-html=\"_footer.html\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    w3IncludeHTML();\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER strapdown -->\n<script src=\"assets/strapdown/strapdown-topbar.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER EVERYTHING -->\n<script src=\"assets/logo.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"assets/themeswitcher.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Some example text is provided.*\n\n### Overview\n&nbsp;\n#### What are the most important facts that a developer should know about this system architecture?\n\n::PARAGRAPH OR BULLETS\n\n#### What software architecture style is being used?\n\n- ::Single-process desktop application (with plug-in extension modules).\n- ::Client-server with a custom thick-clients and server.\n- ::2-tier web application: webserver/app-server, database.\n- ::3-tier web application: webserver, app-server, database.\n- ::Single web service: app-server, database.\n- ::Network of web services.\n- ::Peer-to-peer with/without central server.\n- ::Pipe-and-filter.\n- ::Computing grid / distributed servers.\n\n#### What are the ranked goals of this architecture?\n\n1. ::[Ease of integration](glossary-std.html#ease_of_integration)\n2. ::[Extensibility](glossary-std.html#extensibility)\n3. ::[Capacity matching](glossary-std.html#capacity_matching)\n\n### Components\n&nbsp;\n#### What are the components of this system?\n\n::The components of this system are clearly defined in this [UML Model\n  with Component Diagram](LINK-TO-MODEL).\n\n::The components of this system are listed below by type:\n\n- ::Presentation/UI Components\n  - ::[C-00: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-00)\n- ::Application Logic Components\n  - ::[C-10: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-10)\n- ::Data Storage Components\n  - ::[C-20: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-20)\n\n### Deployment\n&nbsp;\n#### How will the components be deployed to processes and machines?\n\n::The deployment of components to processes and machines is clearly\n  defined in this [UML Model with Deployment Diagram](LINK-TO-MODEL).\n\n::The deployment of components to processes and machines is clearly\n  defined below:\n\n- ::All-in-one server\n  - ::Tomcat process\n    - ::[C-00: Tomcat web server](design-components.html#c-00)\n    - ::[C-10: PROJECTNAME\n      application](design-components.html#c-10)\n  - ::Database process\n    - ::[C-20: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-30)\n\n::The deployment of components to processes and machines is clearly\n  defined below:\n\n- ::Load-balanced front-end servers\n  - ::[C-01: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-00)\n- ::Back-end server\n  - ::JVM process\n    - ::[C-00: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-00)\n    - ::[C-10: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-10)\n    - ::[C-11: PLUG-IN COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-11)\n    - ::[C-12: PLUG-IN COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-12)\n  - Database process\n    - ::[C-20: COMPONENTNAME](design-components.html#c-30)\n\n#### What aspects/resources of their environment are shared?\n\n::Everything is on one server so all machine resources are shared by\n  all components.\n\n::All machines share the same bandwidth to the Internet. All machines\n  access the same file server. So, if one component uses the resources\n  heavily, other components may have to wait.\n\n#### How are requests allocated to redundant or load-balanced servers?\n\n::We are not doing any load-balancing or redundancy for fail-over.\n\n::Load-balancing among front-end servers is handled by a load\n  balancing device that we can make very few assumptions about.\n  However, once a user session is established, the same front-end\n  server will be used for all requests during that session.\n\n#### What alternative deployment configurations are possible?\n\n::This is the only possible deployment.\n\n::The database could be moved to a different machine with a fairly\n  simple change to a configuration file. Otherwise, nothing can be\n  changed about the deployment.\n\n::We have the ability to move the database process to a\n  separate machine. We have the ability to add more front-end servers.\n  The application logic running on the application server cannot be\n  split or load-balanced.\n\n### Integration\n&nbsp;\n\n#### How will components be integrated? Specifically, how will they communicate?\n\n::All of our code uses direct procedure calls. The database is\n  accessed through a driver.\n\n::Components within the same process use direct procedure call or\n  standard Java events. Plug-ins are also accessed through a API of\n  direct procedure calls and standard events. Communication with the\n  database uses a JDBC driver. Communication between the front end-and\n  back-end servers uses XML-RPC.\n\n#### What architectural mechanisms are being used to ease future extensions or modifications?\n\n::We could change the database by switching drivers. Otherwise,\nextensions and modifications can only be done at the design level.\n\n::New front-end components could be added so long as they access the\nback-end the same way. New plug-in components can be dynamically\nloaded, so long as they satisfy the plug-in API. Otherwise, there is\nno ability to add or exchange components, because this architecture\nuses direct dependencies between its components rather than\nimplicit invocation. Extensions and modifications can be made at the\ndesign-level, but deploying those changes requires recompilation\nand down-time.\n\n### Architectural Scenarios\n\n*TODO: Provide architecture scenarios that show how objects will\ncommunicate across components, processes, and machines. Focus on\nscenarios where the architecture itself is changing, e.g., system\nstartup, shutdown, adding or upgrading components, load balancing or\nfail-over.*\n\nThe following sequence diagrams give step-by-step descriptions of how\ncomponents communicate during some important usage scenarios:\n\n- ::[System startup](LINK-TO-DIAGRAM)\n- ::[System shutdown](LINK-TO-DIAGRAM)\n- ::[SCENARIO NAME](LINK-TO-DIAGRAM)\n\n### Architecture Checklist\n\n*TODO: Evaluate your architecture with respect to each of your goals.*\n\n#### Ease of integration: Have mechanisms been provided for all needed types of integration?\n:: Yes. In this system, all of the new components are designed to\n   work together. And, the reused components are integrated via fairly\n   simple interfaces.\n\n#### Extensibility: What types of components can be added later and how?\n:: See above.\n\n#### Capacity matching: How has this architecture matched component resource needs to machines?\n:: The database can be on a machine with RAID disks and a hot-swappable\n   power supply, while the web front-end components can be on cheaper\n   machines that could fail individually without causing\n   system downtime. The front-end web servers and application server\n   are both CPU-intensive, so they are deployed to different CPUs. The\n   database is disk-intensive, so it can be deployed to the same\n   machine as the CPU-intensive application server, with only moderate\n   competition for resources.\n\n#### Has the architecture been communicated to the development team and other stakeholders?\n\n:: Yes, everyone understands. Feedback is welcome.\n\n:: No, this is a risk that is noted in the [Risk\n   Management](plan#risks) section.\n\n<!-- End Markdown content -->\n</xmp>\n\n<div w3-include-html=\"_words-of-wisdom.html\"></div>\n<div w3-include-html=\"_footer.html\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    w3IncludeHTML();\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER strapdown -->\n<script src=\"assets/strapdown/strapdown-topbar.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER EVERYTHING -->\n<script src=\"assets/logo.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"assets/themeswitcher.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It would be much harder to test, document, or\n        package the product without this feature.\n    -   Expected: Key stakeholders strongly desire and expect\n        this feature. It may have been promised to them in a certain\n        release. It's absence would substantially reduce the success of\n        the project.\n    -   Desired: Stakeholders desire this feature. It's absence would\n        reduce the success of the project.\n    -   Optional: This feature would be nice to have. Adding it could\n        have some advantage, but delaying it would not have a big effect\n        on the success of the project.\n-   Effort\n    -   Months: A very large feature that is too big to estimate and\n        should be broken in to smaller, better-defined features.\n    -   Weeks: A large feature that will take 40 to 160 hours to add.\n    -   Days: An average or easy feature that would take less than 40\n        hours to add.\n    -   Hours: A very easy feature that would take less than 8 hours to\n        add\n    -   Note that \"adding\" a feature means doing all of it's design,\n        implementation, technical documentation, user documentation,\n        and testing. Even the easiest feature takes hours to add.\n-   Risk\n    -   Dangerous: Implementing this feature successfully would require\n        overcoming risk factors that are more than three or unknown\n        in number. It should be broken down into parts, better\n        specified, or risk factors should be eliminated prior\n        to implementation.\n    -   3-Risks: Implementing this feature would require three risk\n        factors to be overcome. Any single release should contain at\n        most a few such high-risk features, and contingency plans should\n        be considered. You should be able to list the risks.\n    -   2-Risks: Implementing this feature would require two risk\n        factors to be overcome. This is normal for challenging features.\n        You should be able to list the risks.\n    -   1-Risk: Implementing this feature as specified would require one\n        risk factor to be overcome. This is normal for many features.\n        You should be able to describe the risk.\n    -   Safe: Implementing this feature as specified is just a matter of\n        time and effort, there is no real risk of failure.\n    -   A \"risk factor\" is a task or fact that is currently in doubt,\n        but that must turn out well in order for the feature to be\n        successfully implemented. See tips on managing risk below.\n\n<!-- End Markdown content -->\n</xmp>\n\n<div w3-include-html=\"_words-of-wisdom.html\"></div>\n<div w3-include-html=\"_footer.html\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    w3IncludeHTML();\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER strapdown -->\n<script src=\"assets/strapdown/strapdown-topbar.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER EVERYTHING -->\n<script src=\"assets/logo.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"assets/themeswitcher.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n\n\n",

Much like a test suite, organizing the\nfeature set by priority, functional area, actor, business object, or\nrelease can help identify missing, extra, or poorly motivated features\nearly.\n\n*TODO: Before writing individual feature descriptions, list all the\nfeatures that you think you will need. Organize them so that missing\nfeatures appear as blanks on this page, and extra features will appear\nto be extras that don't fit anywhere. See the [feature\nformat](feature-format#checklist) document for more tips on\nspecifying features and feature sets.*\n\n*TIP: Refer back to the user stories in your [user\nneeds](user-needs) document and to the [use case\nsuite](use-case-suite). Use them for ideas and make sure that you\ncover all of them.*\n\n### Features by Release and Priority\n\n*TODO: Select subset of features can be implemented for a given release.\nWhen features are listed in priority order, choosing the features to\nimplement in a release simply becomes a matter of \"drawing a line\":\nfeatures below the line must wait for a later release. Make sure to also\nconsider estimated effort and risk.*\n\n-   ::Release 1.0\n    -   ::Essential\n        -   ::[F-00](features.html#f-00_site_configuration) Site configuration\n        -   ::[F-01](features.html#f-01_user_regisration) User registration\n        -   ::[F-21](features.html#f-21_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-31](features.html#f-31_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::Expected\n        -   ::[F-02](features.html#f-02_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-03](features.html#f-03_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-20](features.html#f-20_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n-  ::Release 1.1\n    -   ::Expected\n        -   ::[F-22](features.html#f-22_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-23](features.html#f-23_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-33](features.html#f-33_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::Desired\n        -   ::[F-10](features.html#f-10_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-11](features.html#f-11_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-12](features.html#f-12_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n-   ::Later Releases\n    -   ::Optional\n        -   ::[F-30](features.html#f-30_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n        -   ::[F-32](features.html#f-32_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n\n### Features by Release and Risk\n\n-   ::Release 1.0\n    -   ::[F-00](features.html#f-00_site_configurtion) Safe : Site configuration\n    -   ::[F-01](features.html#f-01_user_registration) Safe : User registration\n    -   ::[F-21](features.html#f-21_feature_name) Safe : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-31](features.html#f-31_feature_name) 1-Risk : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-02](features.html#f-02_feature_name) 1-Risk : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-03](features.html#f-03_feature_name) 2-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-20](features.html#f-20_feature_name) 2-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::Total unique risk factors: 4\n-   ::Release 1.1\n    -   ::[F-22](features.html#f-22_feature_name) Safe : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-23](features.html#f-23_feature_name) Safe : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-33](features.html#f-33_feature_name) Safe : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-10](features.html#f-10_feature_name) 2-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-11](features.html#f-11_feature_name) 2-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-12](features.html#f-12_feature_name) 3-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::Total unique risk factors: 5\n-   ::Later Releases\n    -   ::[F-30](features.html#f-30_feature_name) Safe : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-32](features.html#f-32_feature_name) 2-Risks : NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::Total unique risk factors: 2\n\n### Features by Functional Area\n\n-   ::FUNCTIONAL AREA ONE\n    -   ::[F-00](features.html#f-00_site_configuration) Site configuration\n    -   ::[F-01](features.html#f-01_user_registration) User registration\n    -   ::[F-02](features.html#f-02_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-03](features.html#f-03_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n-   ::FUNCTIONAL AREA TWO\n    -   ::[F-10](features.html#f-10_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-11](features.html#f-11_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-12](features.html#f-12_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-13](features.html#f-13_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n-   ::FUNCTIONAL AREA THREE\n    -   ::[F-20](features.html#f-20_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-21](features.html#f-21_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-22](features.html#f-22_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-23](features.html#f-23_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n-   ::FUNCTIONAL AREA FOUR\n    -   ::N/A: These features are completely automated and internal, users\n        never interact with them\n-   ::FUNCTIONAL AREA FIVE\n    -   ::TODO: need to write use cases here\n-   ::Other functional areas\n    -   ::[F-30](features.html#f-30_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-31](features.html#f-31_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-32](features.html#f-32_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n    -   ::[F-33](features.html#f-33_feature_name) NAME OF FEATURE\n\n\n<!-- End Markdown content -->\n</xmp>\n\n<div w3-include-html=\"_words-of-wisdom.html\"></div>\n<div w3-include-html=\"_footer.html\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    w3IncludeHTML();\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER strapdown -->\n<script src=\"assets/strapdown/strapdown-topbar.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER EVERYTHING -->\n<script src=\"assets/logo.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"assets/themeswitcher.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't worry about renumbering if you delete a step.*\n\n| Step      | Description                                               | Estimate |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1.        | ::Preparation                                             |          |\n| 1.1.      | ::Developer training                                      | 30h      |\n| 2.        | ::Inception                                               |          |\n| 2.1.      | ::Requirements gathering                                  | 30h      |\n| 2.2.      | ::Requirements specification                              | 20h      |\n| 2.3.      | ::Requirements validation                                 | 10h      |\n| 3.        | ::Elaboration                                             |          |\n| 3.1.      | ::High-level design                                       | 5h       |\n| 3.2.      | ::Low-level design (break down by component)              |          |\n| 3.2.A.    | ::Object design                                           | 10h      |\n| 3.2.B.    | ::User interface design                                   | 10h      |\n| 3.2.C.    | ::Database design                                         | 3h       |\n| 3.3.      | ::Design review and evaluation                            | 5h       |\n| 4.        | ::Construction                                            |          |\n| 4.1.A.    | ::System implementation                                   |          |\n| 4.1.A.1.  | ::Implement COMPONENT-NAME 1                              | 25h      |\n| 4.1.A.2.  | ::Implement COMPONENT-NAME 2                              | 25h      |\n| 4.1.A.3.  | ::Implement COMPONENT-NAME 3                              | 25h      |\n| 4.1.A.4.  | ::Implement COMPONENT-NAME 4                              | 25h      |\n| 4.1.A.5.  | ::Integrate Components (mostly done during implementation)| 5h       |\n| 4.1.B.    | ::Technical documentation (break down by component)       | 10h      |\n| 4.1.C.    | ::User documentation (break down by component)            | 10h      |\n| 4.1.D.    | ::Testing                                                 |          |\n| 4.1.D.1.  | ::Test planning                                           | 10h      |\n| 4.1.D.2.  | ::Test code implementation (break down by component)      | 30h      |\n| 4.1.D.3.  | ::Test execution                                          | 10h      |\n| 4.2.      | ::Implementation review and evaluation                    | 15h      |\n| 5.        | ::Transition                                              |          |\n| 5.A.      | ::Release packaging                                       | 3h       |\n| 5.B.      | ::Documentation for other groups                          | 3h       |\n| 6.        | ::Reflection                                              |          |\n| 6.1.      | ::Postmortem report                                       | 10h      |\n|           | ::Total                                                   | 329 hours|\n\n### Deliverables in this Release\n\n*TODO: List project deliverables in detail, with delivery dates.*\n\n| Deliverable Name | Description                                                   | Delivery Date |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Deliverable Name | ::Description                                                 | Delivery Date |\n| Deliverable Name | ::Description                                                 | Delivery Date |\n| Deliverable Name | ::Description Description Description Description Description | Delivery Date |\n| Deliverable Name | ::Description                                                 | Delivery Date |\n\n### Schedule for this Release\n\n*TODO: Make the rows in this table match the steps in your WBS above.

If you don't plan to do anything to\nmitigate the risk, state that. Use the risk list below, or the [risks\nworksheet](risks.html).*\n\nPlease see the [risks worksheet](risks.html).\n\n#### The main risks of this project are\n\n1.  ::There is a potential conflict between the goals of a high-quality\n    appearance and one that is completely customizable. We can only\n    succeed if players find the web site appealing, and game vendors can\n    customize it with no more effort than would be needed to build a\n    static website. We already have a design in mind that will address\n    this risk and we will review it with a web site designer who worked\n    for a game vendor site.\n2.  ::There are significant technical difficulties in building a web site\n    and web application. This will be a risk because one person on our\n    team has much experience with the relevant tools and technologies.\n    Although the others will learn, we will certainly make some mistakes\n    and suboptimal choices. We will address this risk by scoping the\n    project such that we have enough time to train and to review the\n    design and implementation.\n3.  ::The schedule for this project is very short. We will manage this by\n    planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series of\n    functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later\n    releases if needed.\n4.  ::The performance of the system will be significantly impacted by the\n    decisions made during the [database design task](#3.2.C). None of\n    our current team members has experience with database optimization.\n    To address this, we will arrange a review meeting with an\n    experienced DBA or hire a consultant from the database vendor.\n5.  ::We could be underestimating known tasks. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n6.  ::We could be underestimating the impact of unknown tasks. HOW TO\n    AVOID/MITIGATE?\n7.  ::We could be underestimating the dependencies between tasks. HOW TO\n    AVOID/MITIGATE?\n8.  ::We could have misunderstood the customer's requirements. HOW TO\n    AVOID/MITIGATE?\n9.  ::The customer could change the requirements. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n10. ::We could face major difficulties with the technology chosen for\n    this project. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n11. ::We could have low quality that demands significant rework. HOW TO\n    AVOID/MITIGATE?\n12. ::We could incorrectly assess our progress until it is too late\n    to react. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n13. ::We could lose resources. E.g., team members could get sick, spend\n    time on other projects, or quit. HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n14. ::There may be a mis-alignment of stakeholder goals or expectations.\n    HOW TO AVOID/MITIGATE?\n\n### Project Planning Dependencies\n&nbsp;\n#### Does this project conflict or compete for resources with any other project?\n\n::No, this is the only project that we are working on.\n\n::Yes, and we have determined how many hours each person can actually\n    dedicate to this project.\n\n#### Are the same human or machine resources allocated to maintenance of past versions and/or planning of future versions during this release time period?\n\n::No, this is the first release and we will not plan the next release.\n\n::Yes, we predict that team members will spend an average of 20% of\n  their time maintaining previous releases and planning future\n  releases during this release time frame. Some weeks may be higher if\n  an urgent patch to a previous release is needed.\n\n#### Does this project depend on the success of any other project?\n\n::No, this project stands alone.\n\n::Yes, project P1 must provide library L, and project P2 must prove\n  the usability of feature F, and....\n\n#### Does any other project depend on this project?\n\n::No, project is not producing any components that will be used in\nother current projects.\n\n::Yes, we must produce library L for our project and support users of\nL in projects P1 and P2.\n\n#### Are there any other important dependencies that will affect this project?\n\n::No, everything is covered above.\n\n::Yes.

We build a quality product and assure its quality by\nkeeping quality in mind all the time and performing the selected\nactivities below. Testing is one QA activity, but it is not the best\nor only one, other QA activities include the use of style guides and\nchecklists, review meetings, use of analysis tools, and careful\nquality measurements and estimates. A plan is needed to select and\ncoordinate all the QA activities.\n\n#### What QA lessons were learned in previous releases?\n\n::None yet. This is the first release.\n\n- ::Different browsers render the same HTML page differently, so we\n  must test each version of each supported browser.\n- ::In a previous release, customers found that punctuation (e.g.,\n  quotation marks and less-than signs) were entered and processed\n  properly, but not displayed properly. From now on, we must test\n  both validation and display of special characters.\n- ::Large datasets can sometimes make our system fail if the space\n  used for temporary data is used up. Our test plans should\n  include more data volume tests.\n\n#### What is the scope of this QA plan?\n\n::All components and aspects of the system will be evaluated in \nthis release.\n\n::There are many quality goals and approaches to assuring them. Since\nwe have limited time and resources for this release, we will focus\non the following components and aspects:\n  \n- ::COMPONENT-1\n- ::COMPONENT-2\n- ::COMPONENT-3\n- ::FEATURE-1\n- ::FEATURE-2\n\n#### What is the summary of this plan?\n::In this release we will continue to use development practices that\nsupport all of our quality goals, but we will focus on functional\ncorrectness and robustness. We will do that with the following major\nactivities:\n\n- ::using if-statements to test preconditions and assert statements\n  to test invariants and postconditions\n- ::conducting frequent reviews\n- ::performing automated unit and regression testing with JUnit\n- ::carrying out structured manual system testing\n- ::keeping all issues up-to-date in an issue tracking database\n\n### Quality Goals for this Release\n\n*TODO: Add or edit goals to fit your project.

Individual projects should not need to\nedit this file. Writing out the definitions of terms and acronyms here\nhelps keep other documents more concise and easy to edit. Check the\n[ReadySET glossary](http://readyset.tigris.org/templates/glossary-std) for\nupdates.\n\nJump to: [General](#general_terms) | \n[Computer science & technology](#computer_science_and_technology_terms) | \n[Process](#process_terms) | \n[Software development tools](#development_tool_terms) |\n[Requirements](#requirements_terms) | [Design](#design_terms) |\n[Design goals terms](#design_goals_terms) | [QA terms](#qa_terms) | \n[QA goals terms](#qa_goals_terms) | [Additional terms](#additional_standard_terms)|\n[Project terms](glossary.html#glossary) \n\n\n### General Terms\n&nbsp;\n##### Chipping away\nThe process of removing sample text from templates when that text\ndoes not apply to the current project. Often some of the sample text\nwill be kept or revised to fit the current project. Even if the\nsample text does not fit the current project, it provides a reusable\nexample of how to phrase that type of description. The term\n\"chipping away\" comes from an old joke: when a sculptor is asked how\nhe carved a marble statue of a horse, he replies \"It was easy, I\njust started with a big block of marble and chipped away everything\nthat did not look like a horse.\"\n\n##### Attached worksheet\nThe idea is similar to filling in an IRS form and using worksheets\nto calculate subtotals or make specific decisions. That is to say,\nthere is a hierarchy to the templates: there are the main templates,\nand then worksheets for specific topics. We have divided the\ninformation into several files so that each file is focused on one\ntopic, and so that each file can be worked on by one person in a\nreasonable amount of time.\n\n##### Process impact\nThe process impact box on each template explains where the current\ntemplate fits into the software development process. It usually\nincludes a brief comment on who should create the document, and who\nwould be expected to make use of it. You can change the process\nimpact box, but you should not need to.\n\n##### Checklist\nThere are two kinds of checklists:\n\n- Many of the templates have a section with questions that help\n  you check your work in that template. Often the sample answers\n  to the questions prompt you to take some corrective action.\n- For design and code review meetings, there are links to\n  guidelines and checklists that help you identify common errors\n  in those artifacts.\n\n##### Sticky note\nThe idea is similar to a post-it note attached to a document that\ntells you do \"sign here\" or fill in a certain part. There are two\ntypes of sticky notes:\n\n- *TODO: Instructs you on how to fill in the template. This is the\n  minimum that you need to do. One of the main goals of ReadySET\n  is to help your team *quickly* carry out basic software\n  engineering activities. The TODO sticky notes make that easy by\n  making the templates more self-explanatory.*\n- TIP: Helps you think of better ways to fill in the template. One\n  of the other main goals of ReadySET is to help your team make\n  better decisions that can make your whole project more\n  successful. The TIP sticky notes help with that.\n\nAfter you have done what the sticky note says, you can delete the\nsticky note.\n\n### Computer Science and Technology Terms\n&nbsp;\n\n###### ::API (Application Programming Interface)\nAn API is a set of functions that one software component makes\navailable to other software components. That allows other programs\nto \"call\" this program via direct function calls, or more indirect\ncommunications such as [SOAP](#soap) messages.\n\n##### ::SOAP\nSOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the message format used by \nstandard web services. It entails sending an XML document to a \nserver in order to invoke an operation on the server-side. \n[More information on SOAP](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Programming/Internet/Web_Services/SOAP/?tc=1).\n\n### Process Terms\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Change Control Board (CCB)\nA group of people who review proposed changes to the project\nrequirements and/or source code to accept or reject changes in each\nparticular release. Proposed changes are usually rejected if they\nintroduce too much risk or would trigger additional effort (e.g.,\nthe need to redo a lot of testing on new code). A CCB is usually\ncomposed of managers and representatives of other stakeholders such\nas the QA group and key customers.\n\n##### Feature Complete\nA release is called \"feature complete\" when the development team\nagrees that no new features will be added to this release. New\nfeatures may still be suggested for later releases. More development\nwork needs to be done to implement all the features and\nrepair defects.\n\n##### Code Complete\nA release is called \"code complete\" when the development team agrees\nthat no entirely new source code will be added to this release.\nThere may still be source code changes to fix defects. There may\nstill be changes to documentation and data files, and to the code\nfor test cases or utilities. New code may be added in a\nfuture release.\n\n##### Internal Release Number\nAn internal release number is the number that the development team\ngives each release. Internal release numbers typically count up\nlogically, i.e., they do not skip numbers. They may have many parts:\ne.g., major, minor, patch-level, build number, RC number.\n\n##### External Release Number\nExternal release numbers are the numbers that users see. Often, they\nwill be the same as the internal release number. That is especially\ntrue if the product being built is a component intended to be reused\nby another engineering group in the same development organization.\nExternal release numbers can be different for products that\nface competition. External release number are simpler, and may not\ncount up logically. E.g., a certain major ISP jumped up to version 8\nof their client software because their competition had released\nversion 8. Later, the competition used version \"10 Optimized\" rather\nthan \"10.1\" or \"11\".\n\n##### Release Number\nThe term \"release number\" by itself refers to an \n[external release number](#external_release_number). Users normally are not aware\nof the existence of any internal release numbers.\n\n### Development Tool Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### Version Control System\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Commit Log Message\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Issue Tracker\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Unit Testing Automation\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Automated Build System\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Source Code Analysis Tool\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Style Checker\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### Source Code Formatter (Pretty Printer)\n::DEFINITION1\n\n#### System Test Automation\n::DEFINITION1\n\n### Requirements Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### Feature specification\nA feature specification focuses on one feature of a software product\nand completely describes how that feature can be used. It includes a\nbrief description of the purpose of the feature, the input and\noutput, and any constraints. Individual bullet items give precise\ndetails on all aspects of the feature. One feature may be used in\nmany different ways as part of many different use cases.\n\n#### Use case\nThe main part of a use case is a set of steps that give an example\nof how an [actor](#actor) can use the product to succeed at\na goal. These steps are called the \"Main success scenario\", and they\ninclude both user intentions and system responses. One use case may\nshow how the actor uses several features to accomplish a goal.\n\n#### Actor\nA user or an external system that uses the system being built.\n\n### Design Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### ::TERM2\n::DEFINITION2\n\n### Design Goals Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### Correctness\nThis design correctly matches the given requirements.\n\n#### Feasibility\nThis design can be implemented and tested with the planned amount of\ntime and effort.\n\n#### Understandability\nDevelopers can understand this design and correctly implement it.\n\n#### Implementation phase guidance\nThis design divides the implementation into components or aspects\nthat can correspond to reasonable implementation tasks.\n\n####  Modularity\nConcerns are clearly separated so that the impact of most design\nchanges would be limited to only one or a few modules.\n\n#### Extensibility\nNew features or components can be easily added later.\n\n#### Testability\nIt is easy to test components of this design independently, and\ninformation is available to help diagnose defects.\n\n#### Efficiency\nThe design enables the system to perform functions with an\nacceptable amount of time, storage space, bandwidth, and\nother resources.\n\n#### Ease of integration\nThe components will work together.\n\n#### Capacity matching\nThe architecture deploys components onto machines that provide\nneeded resources with reasonable total expense.\n\n#### Expressiveness\nIt allows for storage of all valid values and relationships\n\n#### Ease of access\nApplication code to access stored data is simple\n\n#### Reliability\nStored data cannot easily be corrupted by defective code, concurrent\naccess, or unexpected process termination\n\n#### Data capacity\nThe system can store the amount of data needed.\n\n#### Data security\nProtection of sensitive user and corporate data from unauthorized\naccess or modification\n\n#### Performance\nData can be accessed quickly\n\n#### Interoperability\nThe database or data files can be accessed and updated by other\napplications\n\n#### Intrusion prevention\nPrevent, e.g., hackers opening a command shell on our server.\n\n#### Abuse prevention\nPrevention of abuse (e.g., using our system to send spam).\n\n#### Auditability\nAll changes can be accounted for later.\n\n#### Understandability and learnability\nUsers can reasonably be expected to understand the UI at\nfirst sight. Users will be able to discover additional features\nwithout aid from other users or documentation, and they will be able\nto recall what they have learned.\n\n#### Task support and efficiency\nThe UI is well matched to the users' tasks and it can be used with a\nreasonable number of clicks and keystrokes.\n\n#### Safety\nUsers are not likely to accidentally produce an undesired result\n(e.g., delete data, or send a half-finished email).\n\n#### Consistency and familiarity\nUsers can apply their knowledge of similar UIs or UI standards to\nthis system.\n\n### QA Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### Bug\n*n.* **Deprecated** since 1991. See [defect](#defect).\n\n#### Error\n*v.* A mistaken thought in the developer's mind. Often caused by\nmiscommunication or bad assumptions. Errors can create\n[defects](#defect). E.g., a developer might erroneously think that\nthe square root of -4 is -2.\n\n#### Defect\n*n.* The result of the developer's [error](#error) embodied in the\nproduct source code, initial data, or documents. E.g., a square root\nfunction which allows negative numbers as arguments is defective.\nDefects can be removed by changing the source code, initial data,\nor document.\n\n#### Fault\n*n.* The execution of defective code. E.g., if a certain input is\nprovided to defective code, it may cause an exception, or go into an\ninfinite loop, or store an incorrect value in an internal variable.\nA fault is not normally visible to users, only the\n[failure](#failure) is visible.\n\n#### Failure\n*n.* The user-visible result of a [fault](#fault). E.g., an error\nmessage or an incorrect result. This is evidence that can be\nreported in a defect report. Developers use failure evidence during\ndebugging to eventually find and remove [defects](#defect).\n\n### QA Goals Terms\n&nbsp;\n#### Functionality &gt; Correctness\nCorrectness is the most basic quality goal. It means that, when\nvalid inputs are given and the system is in a valid state and under\nreasonable load, the system's behavior and results will be correct.\n\n#### Functionality &gt; Robustness\nRobustness is the system's ability to gracefully handle\ninvalid inputs. It should never be possible for any user input to\ncrash the system or corrupt data, even if that user input is\nabnormal, unexpected, or malicious.\n\n#### Functionality &gt; Accuracy\nAccuracy refers to the mathematical precision of calculations done\nby the system. Any system that does numeric calculations must\nconsider accuracy, e.g., financial or scientific applications.\n\n#### Functionality &gt; Compatibility\nSystems that claim to follow standards or claim compatibility with\nexisting systems must adhere to the relevant file formats,\nprotocols, and APIs. The relevant standards are linked at the top of\nthis document.\n\n#### Functionality &gt; Factual correctness\nIs the data in the system a true representation of the real world?\nAny system that contains initial data or gathers data about the real\nworld should be sure that the data is factually correct. E.g., a tax\npreparation program should embody correct and up-to-date facts about\ntax law.\n\n#### Usability &gt; Understandability and Readability\nUsers need to understand the system to use it. The basic metaphor\nshould be understandable and appropriate to user tasks. Some defects\nin understandability include unclear metaphors, poor or hard-to-see\nlabels, lack of feedback to confirm the effects of user actions, and\nmissing or inadequate on-line help.\n\n#### Usability &gt; Learnability and Memorability\nEvery user interface contains some details that users will need to\nlearn and remember. E.g., Alt-F to open the \"File\" menu. UI cues and\nrules can make these details easier to learn and remember. E.g., the\n\"F\" is underlined and, as a rule, the first letter is usually the\naccelerator key.\n\n#### Usability &gt; Task support\nThis is the quality of match between user tasks and the system's UI.\nTask support defects are cases where the system forces the user to\ntake unnatural steps to accomplish a task or where the user is given\nno support for a difficult step in a task. E.g., must the user\ninvent an 8-character filename for their \"Christmas card list\"?\nE.g., must users total their own tax deductions?\n\n#### Usability &gt; Efficiency\nUsers should be able to accomplish common tasks with\nreasonable effort. Common tasks should be possible with only one or\ntwo steps. The difficulty of each step should also be considered.\nE.g., does the user have to remember a long code number or click on\na very small button?\n\n#### Usability &gt; Safety\nHumans are error-prone, but the negative effects of common errors\nshould be limited. E.g., users should realize that a given command\nwill delete data, and be asked to confirm their intent or have the\noption to undo.\n\n#### Usability &gt; Consistency and Familiarity\nUsers should be able to apply their past experience from other\nsimilar systems. This means that user interface standards should be\nfollowed, and common conventions should be used whenever possible.\nAlso, UI elements that appear in several parts of the UI should be\nused consistently, unless another UI quality takes priority. E.g.,\nif most currency entry fields do not require a dollar-sign, then one\nthat does demand it is a consistency defect, unless there is a real\nchance that the user is dealing with another currency on that step\nin his/her task.\n\n#### Usability &gt; Subjective satisfaction\nUsers should feel generally satisfied with the UI. This is a\nsubjective quality that sums up the other user interface qualities\nas well as aesthetics.\n\n#### Security\nThe system should allow usage only by authorized users, and restrict\nusage based on permissions. The system should not allow users to\nside-step security rule or exploit security holes. E.g., all user\ninput should be validated and any malicious input should\nbe rejected.\n\n#### Reliability &gt; Consistency under load\nEvery system has some capacity limits. What happens when those\nlimits are exceeded? The system should never lose or corrupt data.\n\n#### Reliability &gt; Consistency under concurrency\nSystems that allow concurrent access by multiple users, or that use\nconcurrency internally, should be free of race conditions\nand deadlock.\n\n#### Reliability &gt; Availability under load\nEvery system has some capacity limits. What happens when those\nlimits are exceeded? The system should continue to service those\nrequests that it is capable of handling. It should not crash or stop\nprocessing all requests.\n\n#### Reliability &gt; Longevity\nThe system should continue to operate as long as it is needed. It\nshould not gradually use up a limited resource. Example longevity\ndefects include memory leaks or filling the disk with log files.\n\n#### Efficiency\nThe system's operations should execute quickly, with reasonable use\nof machine and network resources. E.g., if one user does one\noperation, it should execute efficiently.\n\n#### Scalability\nScalability is a general quality that holds when the system\ncontinues to satisfy its requirements when various usage parameters\nare increased. E.g., a file server might be scalable to a high\nnumber of users, or to very large files or very high capacity disks.\nSeveral specific scalability goals are listed below.\n\n#### Scalability &gt; Performance under load\nThis is a specific type of scalability goal dealing with the\nperformance of the system at times when it is servicing many\nrequests from many users.\n\n#### Scalability &gt; Large data volume\nThis is a specific type of scalability goal dealing with the ability\nfor the system to handle large data sets. Operations should continue\nto be correct and efficient as data set size increases. Furthermore,\nthe user interface should still be usable as the data presented to\nusers increases in length.\n\n#### Operability\nThe long-term needs of system administrators should be\nreliably supported. E.g., is the system easy to install? Can the\nadministrator recover from a crash? Is there sufficient log output\nto diagnose problems in the field? Can the system's data be backed\nup without downtime? Can the system be upgraded practically?\n\n#### Maintainability &gt; Understandability\nWill it be easy for (future) developers to understand how the system\nworks?\n\n#### Maintainability &gt; Evolvability\nCan the system easily be modified and extended over time?\n\n#### Maintainability &gt; Testability\nCan the system easily be tested? Do the requirements precisely\nspecify possible inputs and the desired results? Can the system be\ntested in parts? When failures are observed, can they be traced back\nto defects in specific components (i.e., debugging)? Is testing\npractical with the available testing tools?\n\n### Additional Standard Terms\n\nFor additional standard terms, see the following reference sites:\n\n-   [Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/)\n-   [Whatis.com](http://www.whatis.com/)\n-   [NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures](http://www.nist.gov/dads/)\n-   [Free on-line dictionary of computing](http:/http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/index.html)\n-   [IBM's glossary of computing terms](http://www-3.ibm.com/ibm/terminology/goc/gocmain.htm)\n-   [Jargon File](http://www.jargon.org/)\n\n</xmp>\n\n<div w3-include-html=\"_words-of-wisdom.html\"></div>\n<div w3-include-html=\"_footer.html\"></div>\n\n<script>\n\tw3IncludeHTML();\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"http://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER strapdown -->\n<script src=\"assets/strapdown/strapdown-topbar.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Include it AFTER EVERYTHING -->\n<script src=\"assets/logo.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"assets/themeswitcher.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",
