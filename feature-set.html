**Process impact:** A feature set is simply a table of contents for the
individual feature descriptions. Much like a test suite, organizing the
feature set by priority, functional area, actor, business object, or
release can help identify missing, extra, or poorly motivated features
early.

*TODO: Before writing individual feature descriptions, list all the
features that you think you will need. Organize them so that missing
features appear as blanks on this page, and extra features will appear
to be extras that don't fit anywhere. See the [feature
format](feature-format#checklist) document for more tips on
specifying features and feature sets.*

*TIP: Refer back to the user stories in your [user
needs](user-needs) document and to the [use case
suite](use-case-suite). Use them for ideas and make sure that you
cover all of them.*

### Features by Release and Priority

*TODO: Select subset of features can be implemented for a given release.
When features are listed in priority order, choosing the features to
implement in a release simply becomes a matter of "drawing a line":
features below the line must wait for a later release. Make sure to also
consider estimated effort and risk.*
