**Process impact:** This is a set of detailed feature descriptions.

TODO: For each feature listed in the [feature set](feature-set),
give a detailed description of the feature here. Describe each feature
in enough detail that it could be implemented by any member of the
development team (not only someone who already informally knows what to
do).

TIP: Start with a short textual description of each feature. Then, add
more formal information as needed to make each description precise and
unambiguous. E.g.,
-   Precisely define valid inputs, and error handling
-   Specify data structures with UML or logical schema
-   Specify UI aspects of features with tiny mock-ups
-   Specify key decisions with decision trees or tables
-   Specify key algorithms with pseudo-code or flow charts
-   Specify state-based behavior with state machines or tables
-   Specify sequences of events with scenario diagrams
